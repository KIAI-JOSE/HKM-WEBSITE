            <p className="mb-4">
              We believe that the Holy Bible was written by men supernaturally inspired; that it has truth without any admixture of error for its matter; and therefore is, and shall remain to the end of the age, the only complete and final revelation of the will of God to man; the true center of Christian union and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds, and opinions should be tried.

              <li>By "The Holy Bible" we mean that collection of sixty-six books, from Genesis to Revelation, as originally written does not only contain and convey the Word of God, but is the very Word of God.</li>
              <li>By "inspiration" we mean that the books of the Bible were written by holy men of old as they were moved by the Holy Spirit, in such a definite way that their writings were supernaturally and verbally inspired and free from error, as no others' writings have been or ever will be inspired.</li>

              We believe that there is one, and only one, living and true God, an infinite, intelligent Spirit, the maker and supreme ruler of heaven and earth inexpressibly glorious in holiness and worthy of all possible honor, confidence, and love; that in the unity of the Godhead there are three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, equal in every divine perfection, and executing distinct but harmonious offices in the great work of redemption.

We hold him to be man's great tempter, the accuser of the saints, and to the judgment of eternal justice in a hell, a place prepared for him and his angels.

              We believe that the salvation of sinners is wholly of grace; through the mediatorial offices of the Son of God; who by appointment of the Father, freely took upon Him our nature, yet without sin, honored the divine law by His personal obedience and by His death made a full and vicarious atonement for our sins; that His atonement consisted not in setting us an example by His death as a martyr but was the voluntary substitution of himself in the sinner's place, the just dying for the unjust, Christ, the Lord, bearing our sins in His own body on the tree, that, the having risen from the dead, He is now enthroned in heaven and uniting in His wonderful person the tenderest of sympathies with divine perfection, He is every way qualified to be a suitable, a compassionate and all sufficient Savior.

              We believe that in order to be saved, sinners must be born again; that the new birth is a new creation in Jesus Christ; that it is instantaneous and not a process; that in the new birth, the one dead in trespasses and sins is made a partaker in the divine nature and received eternal life, the free gift of God; that the new creation is brought about in a manner above our comprehension, not by culture, not by character, nor by the will of man, but wholly and solely by the power of the Holy Spirit in connection with divine truth, so as to secure our voluntary obedience to the gospel; that its proper evidence appears in the holy fruits of repentance and faith and newness of life.

We do not believe in the reversal of this order; we hold that the local church has the absolute right of self government, free from the interference of any hierarchy of individuals or organizations; and that the one and only superintendent is Christ through the Holy Spirit; that it is scriptural for true churches to cooperate with each other in contending for the faith and for the furtherance of the Gospel; that every church is the sole and only judge of the measure and method of its cooperation; on all matters of membership, of policy, of government, of discipline, of benevolence, the will of the local church is final.

            <p className="mb-4">
              We believe in and accept the sacred Scriptures upon these subjects at their face and full value. Of the Resurrection, we believe that Christ rose bodily "The third day according to the Scriptures," that He ascended" to the right hand of the throne of God" that He alone is our merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God;"" that this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven"-bodily, personally and visibly; that the" dead in Christ shall rise first." That the living saints" shall all b changed in moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump," "that the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His Father David," and that "Christ shall reign a thousand years in righteousness until He hath put all enemies under His feet."

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-church-800 mb-2">Of Human Sexuality:</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We believe that God created human sexuality to be an expression of love and unity between a biological man and a biological woman within the covenant of marriage. (Genesis 2:18-25, Matthew 19:3-6, 1 Corinthians 7:2-4, Ephesians 5:22-33) We believe that any heterosexual sexual activity outside the bond of marriage (including fornication and adultery), any homosexual sexual activity, and any other form of sexual immorality (including bisexual conduct, bestiality, incest, and use of pornography) is an abomination to the Lord (Leviticus 18:19-23), is an indication of sin's decaying effects, deserving of God's righteous judgment (Romans 1:26-32), excludes one from inclusion in the kingdom of God if continually practiced, and can be conquered through Christ's sacrifice on the cross resulting in lasting change (I Corinthians 6:9-11).
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-church-800 mb-2">Of Marriage:</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We believe that the term "marriage" has only one meaning: the uniting of one biological man and one biological woman in a single, exclusive, permanent, convenantal union, that displays God's redemptive work for His Church. (Genesis 2:18-25, Matthew 19:3-6; Ephesians 5:22-33) We believe that scripture condemns all homosexual activity and that marriage, by God's design, can only be entered into by a heterosexual couple.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-church-800 mb-2">Of Gender Identity:</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We believe that God wonderfully and immutably creates each person as male or female. These two distinct, complementary genders together reflect the image of God. (Genesis 1:26-27) Rejection of one's biological gender is a rejection of the purpose of God for that person's gender and a repudiation and denial of the glory of God in His creation of that person. (Psalm139:13-16)
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-church-800 mb-2">Of Christian Love:</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We believe that every person must be afforded compassion, love, kindness, respect, and dignity for the sake of the gospel. (Mark 12:28-31; Luke 6:31.) We believe that the most loving thing one can do is share the truth of what the Bible says about sinful behavior and the hope that the gospel brings (Romans 6:15-23). Hateful and harassing behavior or attitudes directed toward any Individual are to be repudiated and are not in accord with Scripture, the message of the gospel, nor the doctrines of Heavenly God kingdom churches.
