Father God, thank You for Your love. Help us to love others as You love us. Amen.

God’s love is patient, kind, and forgiving. As Christians, we are called to reflect this love in our daily lives. Loving others is one of the greatest ways to show our faith.

Are you showing love to everyone around you?

Who can you show kindness to today?

Lord, fill our hearts with Your love so we may share it with others. Amen.
